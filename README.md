## User Stories

| Spec     | Behavior | 
| -------- | -------- | 
| 1 | As a librarian, I want to create, read, update, delete, and list books in the catalog, so that we can keep track of our inventory. | 
| 2 | As a librarian, I want to search for a book by author or title, so that I can find a book easily when the book inventory at the library grows large. |
| 3 | As a patron, I want to check a book out, so that I can take it home with me. |
| 4 | As a patron, I want to see a history of all the books I checked out, so that I can look up the name of that awesome sci-fi novel I read three years ago. |
| 5 | As a patron, I want to know when a book I checked out is due, so that I know when to return it. |
| 6 | As a librarian, I want to see a list of overdue books, so that I can call up the patron who checked them out and tell them to bring them back - OR ELSE! |
| 7 | As a librarian, I want to enter multiple authors for a book, so that I can include accurate information in my catalog. |
